# Vani

> Rendering should be explicit, local, and predictable.

Vani is a small, dependency-free UI runtime. It is runtime-first and DOM-anchored, with explicit
updates and opt-in fine-grained state.

## Core principles

- Explicit updates (no hidden re-rendering)
- Subtree ownership via anchors
- Runtime-first, no compiler
- Opt-in signals for fine-grained updates

# or
