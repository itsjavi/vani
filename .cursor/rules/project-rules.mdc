# General Project Rules

- When we talk about Vani, or Vani's runtime code, or Vani's lib/library, we always refer to the
  project's `src/vani` directory, where the library's code is located.

- For writing `vani` code that will be run in this project, always import `vani` from the `src/vani`
  directory. Examples in documentantion must always use the `@vanijs/vani` package name.

- Before changing Vani's runtime code always keep in mind Vani's core design principles and
  philosophy, as described in DOCS.md. Always confirm with the user any change that contradicts
  these principles.

- When changing Vani's runtime code, always update the runtime tests in `bench/debug/*`, and the
  benchmark tests in `bench/frameworks/vani` to ensure the changes are working as expected.

- When changing Vani's runtime code, always update the project's docs everywhere:
  DOCS/skills/spa-app/landing page examples + add the decisions backed up by good reasoning in
  CHANGELOG.md to the root of the project (keeping same format). Also review the cursur rules, and
  any other important markdown documents, looking for any inconsistencies or outdated information.

- When changing Vani's ecosystem tools (anything under `src/ecosystem`), always update the Vani docs
  in `DOCS.md` to ensure the changes are working as expected.

- When changing benchmarking code (anything under `bench`), always keep in mind the rules defined in
  `bench/README.md`.
