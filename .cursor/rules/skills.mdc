# Skills

Skills are essentially modular tools that enhance AI Coding Agent's existing functionality, allowing
them to perform specific tasks related to a certain project or library, and other operations. They
bridge the gap between what an AI can do natively and what it needs to accomplish specific, complex
workflows.

Skills are stored in the `./skills` directory of the project or library themselves for other users
to be able to install them in their own projects, and e.g. make their AIs experts in that matter.
For example, we could install React skills in our own project to make our AI an expert in React.

Skills can be installed in the projects that want to consume them by using
`npx add-skill <repo-name-or-url>`.

## Skills Usage in Chat

- When asked to implement a feature, first check whether a relevant skill exists under `./skills`
  and use it as a guide if applicable.
- If multiple skills apply, prefer the most specific one and mention any secondary skills used.

## Skills Creation

- Skills for this repo live under `./skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`. They are consumer skills,
  specific to the `vani` framework.
- Keep skill content self-contained and only reference APIs from `@vanijs/vani` or other public
  packages.
- Avoid referencing source code or files outside `./skills`.
- Use a clear `description` field so skills are discoverable and easy to invoke.
- When a skill expects arguments, use an `## Arguments` section to describe them.
- Skill directories can also contain other files (scripts, docs, etc.), that the SKILL.md can
  reference.
- Use @https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vercel-labs/add-skill/refs/heads/main/README.md for more
  info
- Use always the template provided bellow.

### SKILL.md Markdown Template

This is the skill basic markdown template, that can be of course extended. Mandatory fields are
`name` and `description`.

Replace `# My Skill` and the content of the sections with the actual name and sections content of
the skill.

Template:

```md
---
name: my-skill
description: What this skill does and when to use it
---

# My Skill

Instructions for the agent to follow when this skill is activated.

## When to Use

Describe the scenarios where this skill should be used.

## Steps

1. First, do this
2. Then, do that

## Arguments

- arg1 - Description (defaults to X)
- arg2 - Description (defaults to Y)

## Examples

Example 1 usage pattern

Example 2 usage pattern

## Output

Show example JSON or text output

# Present Results to User

Here we define how the AI Agent should format and present the output to the user in a human-friendly
way. It can be a simple text message or a JSON object, markdown, a table, etc.
```

### How to ask an LLM agent to write skills?

This is an example prompt:

```
Come up with a series of useful skills that would be nice to have for any dev using this project.

Skills are like commands that give instructions to AI Agents about how to perform certain tasks.

Write some skills based on the project documentation documented in @DOCS.md , according to the
guidelines provided in the skills.mdc file. You can visit any links provided in this file to
get more information.
```
